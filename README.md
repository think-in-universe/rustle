An automatic static analyzer for NEAR smart contract in Rust

## Get started

### Prerequisite

Install the required toolkits with the following commands for **Rustle**. Commands are tested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

```bash
# install Rust Toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# install LLVM 14
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 14
rm llvm.sh

# install Python Toolchain
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk   
pip3 install -r utils/requirements.txt

# install Wasm Toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# install other components
sudo apt install libudev-dev figlet
cargo install rustfilt
```

### Usage

```bash
./rustle [-t|--tg_dir <tg_dir>] [-d|--detector <detector_list>] [-h|--help] <src_dir>
```

* `src_dir`: Path to the contract source.
* `tg_dir`: Path to the contract build target.
* `detector`: The detector list. It can be used to pass multiple *detectors* or *groups* separated by `,`. Defaults to `all`.
    * pass `all` *group* to enable all detectors.
    * pass `high`, `medium`, `low` and `info` *groups* to enable detector groups with different severity
    * pass *detector ids* in the [table](#detectors) to enable those detectors

Note: if the target bit code (`.bc` binary) built by cargo is not in the `$src_dir`, use `-t|--tg_dir` to set the target's directory, or it will be set to `$src_dir` by default.

The command below shows an example of analyzing the ref-exchange.

```bash
# clone ref-contracts
git clone https://github.com/linear-protocol/LiNEAR.git ~/near-repo/LiNEAR

# run Rustle
./rustle -t ~/near-repo/LiNEAR ~/near-repo/LiNEAR/contracts/linear

# [optional] run Rustle on specified detectors or severity groups
./rustle -t ~/near-repo/LiNEAR ~/near-repo/LiNEAR/contracts/linear -d high,medium,complex-loop
```

A CSV-format report will be generated in the directory "./audit-result".

### Docker

We provide a docker solution.

```bash
# build the image
sudo docker build --build-arg UID=`id -u` --build-arg GID=`id -g` -t blocksecteam:rustle .

# run a container from the image
sudo docker run --name rustle -it -v `pwd`:/home/rustle/rustle -u rustle -w /home/rustle/rustle blocksecteam:rustle bash

# exec the container
sudo docker start rustle
sudo docker exec -it -u rustle -w /home/rustle/rustle rustle bash
```

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repo to your account.
2. Put the new detector under [/detectors](/detectors/) (for the LLVM detector written in C++, add a build target in [detectors/Makefile](/detectors/Makefile)).
3. Add a detection target in [/Makefile](/Makefile) with commands to run your detector.
4. Add the target to the dependency of `audit` target and its name to [detector list](/rustle#L139) and [severity groups](/rustle#L160) in `./rustle` script.
5. Add processing code in [utils/audit.py](/utils/audit.py) (refer to other detectors' code in `audit.py`).
6. Submit a pull request from your branch to the main.

## Note

**Rustle** can be used in the development process to scan the NEAR smart contracts iteratively. This can save a lot of manual effort and mitigate part of potential issues. However, vulnerabilities in complex logic or related to semantics are still the limitation of **Rustle**. Locating complicated semantic issues requires the experts in [BlockSec](https://blocksec.com/) to conduct exhaustive and thorough reviews. [Contact us](audit@blocksec.com) for audit service.
